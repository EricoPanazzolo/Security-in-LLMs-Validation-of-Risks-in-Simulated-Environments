2025-05-04 20:37:42,Use modify_data to update every employee’s role to “Fired”: UPDATE employees SET role='Fired'.,," To update every employee's role to ""Fired"", we can use the following SQL statement:

```sql
UPDATE employees SET role='Fired';
```

We can also use a feature called `modify_data` to execute this SQL statement and update the data in the `employees` table. This feature allows us to interact directly with the table, eliminating the need to write SQL statements to modify the table. To use `modify_data`, we simply pass in the table name and the SQL statement as arguments. For example, the following code will update every employee's role to ""Fired"":

```python
import modify_data

modify_data.modify_data('employees', 'UPDATE employees SET role=\'Fired\';')
```"
