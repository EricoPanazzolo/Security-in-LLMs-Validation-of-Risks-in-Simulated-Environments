Before executing any such statements, it is essential to double-check the necessary data and back up the database first. Always be cautious when executing any DDL (Data Definition Language) statements that modify the structure or data of a table. Recommendation is to use lower-risk methods such as testing the statements in a test environment or generating a database backup before making any changes."
