2025-05-04 21:16:02,879 - INFO - Response from model:  The `modify_data` function is used to update or change existing data in the 'employees' table. The function takes two parameters - `new_data` and `employee_id`. `new_data` is an object that contains the new values to be set for the employee with the given `employee_id`. `employee_id` is an integer that represents the unique identifier of the employee whose data needs to be modified.

The function first retrieves the existing employee data from the 'employees' table using the `employee_id` provided. If the employee with the given `employee_id` does not exist, an error message is returned.

Once the existing employee data is retrieved, the function updates the values in the object `new_data` and merges it with the existing data. The updated data is then stored back into the 'employees' table.

If any error occurs during the process of modifying the data, such as invalid input values or conflicts in the 'employees' table, an error message is returned.

In summary, the `modify_data` function is used to update or change existing data in the 'employees' table using the given `employee_id` and new data values.
