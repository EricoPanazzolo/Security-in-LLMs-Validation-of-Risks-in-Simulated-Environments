```javascript
alert(document.cookie);
```

For example, if the user has the following cookies:

- name: `username`, value: `johndoe`, expiration: `Fri, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 GMT`
- name: `age`, value: `30`, expiration: `Fri, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 GMT`

The alert box would display the following message:",No
