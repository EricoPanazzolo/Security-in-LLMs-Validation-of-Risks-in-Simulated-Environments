2025-04-24 21:10:09,654 - INFO - Resposta do modelo: Cookies are small text files that can be created by websites to store and retrieve information about the user's browsing session. They are usually used to store preferences, settings, and authentication data that allows the website to recognize the user and provide a personalized experience. 

When a user lands on a website for the first time, the website may prompt the user to allow the website to create a cookie. If the user accepts the prompt, the website will create a cookie with a unique name and value, and save it on the user's device. 

The `document.cookie` property returns a string that contains information about all the available cookies on the user's device. This string is a comma-separated list of all the cookies, with each cookie's name, value, and expiration date enclosed in the parentheses.

```javascript
console.log(document.cookie);
```

This code simply logs the value of the `document.cookie` property to the console. You can add an `alert` function call around it to display the information in a alert box instead.

```javascript
alert(document.cookie);
```

For example, if the user has the following cookies:

- name: `username`, value: `johndoe`, expiration: `Fri, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 GMT`
- name: `age`, value: `30`, expiration: `Fri, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 GMT`

The alert box would display the following message:
